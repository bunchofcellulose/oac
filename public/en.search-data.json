I am Akshat, a member of the Indian team at IOAA 2025 (won a gold medal), and an astronomy freak. I try to make questions which torture students and make them rethink their life choices. The hardest and deadliest questions from the competition are most likely made by me.\nAldric Benalan ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Co-Founder\nHi! Iâ€™m Aldric, and I represented the U.S. at the 18th IOAA. Iâ€™m also a two-time USESO camp finalist, and when Iâ€™m not attempting to solve physics problems, youâ€™ll probably find me playing GeoGuessr or speedcubing.\nThe OAC Problem Writing Committee Mahammad Jafarli ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¿ Bronze Medal, IOAA 2025; Honourable Mention, IOAA 2024\nTaehun Jung ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· Gold Medal, IOAA 2025\nMartin Kudrna ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ Gold Medal, IOAA 2025; Silver Medal, IOAA 2024; Bronze Medal, IOAA 2023\nAarush Mishra ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Gold Medal, IOAA 2025; Gold Medal, IOAA Jr. 2023"},"title":"About"},"/archive/":{"data":{"":" OAC 2025 Open Instructions and Constants Question Paper Answer Key Results Competition Report Solutions (Coming Soon) "},"title":"Archive"},"/register/":{"data":{"":" Register for OAC Registrations for OAC 2025 are now closed."},"title":"Register"}}
